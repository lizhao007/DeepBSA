# DeepBSA
DeepBSA is a novel bulked segregant analysis (BSA) software for the dissection of complex traits. Two brand-new algorithms are developed in DeepBSA named deep learning (DL) and k-value (K), which can be applied on different number (at least 2) of bulked pools. DeepBSA also integrates five widely used algorithms - ED4, delta SNP_index, G', Ridit and SmoothLOD, and DL performs better than them with absolute bias and signal-noise-ratio in our simulation. Overall, DeepBSA provides a user-friendly, OS-compatible, and all-in-one pipeline, which do not need sophisticated bioinformatics skills for BSA.
The “Instruction or Manual” file of software was packed into the DeepBSA.zip.
